# GitHub Upload Instructions

## Project Preparation Complete
Your project has been successfully prepared for GitHub upload! The submodule issue with the `prototype dev 2.0 IMP` folder has been fixed, and a `.gitignore` file has been added to exclude unnecessary files.

## Steps to Upload Your Project to GitHub

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the '+' icon in the top-right corner and select 'New repository'
3. Name your repository (e.g., "project-prototype")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license
7. Click 'Create repository'

### 2. Push to GitHub
After creating your GitHub repository, you'll see instructions on the page. Use the commands for "push an existing repository from the command line":

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/project-prototype.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Your Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and folders uploaded
3. Make sure the `prototype dev 2.0 IMP` folder shows as a regular folder with its contents visible

## Troubleshooting
- If you're prompted for GitHub credentials, enter your GitHub username and personal access token (not your password)
- If you need to create a personal access token, go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
- Make sure to give the token appropriate permissions (at minimum, 'repo' permissions)

## What's Been Done
- Fixed the submodule issue with the `prototype dev 2.0 IMP` folder
- Added a `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules and other unnecessary files
- Created a commit with all your project files ready to be pushed
